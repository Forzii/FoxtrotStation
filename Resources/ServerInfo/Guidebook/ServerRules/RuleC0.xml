 A lot of these rules are going to be inspired by Floofstation, but it is still MANDATORY to read these before playing for the first time on Foxtrot Station, because there are rules that specifically target the HRP aspect this server has.

   These rules apply at all times, including between rounds.

  Each section contains its own list of rules. Click on the section name to view the full version.
